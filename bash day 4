LOOPS
for loop:

for i in {1..10} #i is the loop initialized var, the list can be strings sep by spaces, output of a cmd, an array etc
do 
  echo $i
done

if [[ ]]

fi

counter=1
while [[$counter -le 10 ]] # until works too, but the other way. until meets the condition, opposed to while the cond is true
do
  echo $counter
  ((counter++))
done
echo "All done!"

break breaks out the current loop

continue moves on to the next iteratons
